## 1&1 CloudServer "NGCS" .Net-Wrapper

#### Synopsis

Wanted to create a .Net wrapper for developers to be able to start throwing into their applications to control their 1&1 Cloud Servers.

This is only for the "Next Generation Cloud Servers" by 1&1 which has the Cloud Panel. If you have the Virtual Dedicated Server (VDS) or Dynamic Cloud Server (DCS) then this won't work for you.

Code layout is based off of my NGCS-PHP wrapper.

Code currently includes a prototype Windows Form application. End-product will just be the .DLL file but for now, I find coding visually to be the best method for me.
